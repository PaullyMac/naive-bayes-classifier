## Introduction
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' Theorem and assumes independence between predictors. This project demonstrates the implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier for educational purposes.

## Features
- Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier for the TREC06 Corpus dataset on spam and ham detection on emails. 
- Step-by-step explanation of the algorithm.
